## Intro

I started to meditate around three years ago, to be more precise my personal meditation journal starts on 1 september 2015. Yes I do keep a meditation journal. I started 20 minutes sessions per day, mostly breath awareness.

During first two years my practice consistency was very poor, there were entire months without a single sit, but starting january 2018 I started to work very hard on my consistency cause:

> _Devotion_ and _consistency_ are the key components to accomplish any goal.

Now I sit daily for two hours. One hour in the morning and the other in the evening. Most of people that I am in touch are telling that two hours is just a waist of time, but I can assure them that even two hours per day is not enough to keep with the amount of negativity that we collect daily.

> Meditation is like a _garbage collector_, helps me to clear my mind and makes enough room for me to be efficient.

## Caveats

I want to clarify the term meditation, or how do I understand it.

> _Meditation_ is a psycho spiritual practice, where a person (meditator) sits usually in a sitting unchanged position for a limited amount of time, and keeps the concentration on a specific object. When the mind wanders away the meditator gently returns the awareness to the initial object.

There are thousands different techniques of meditation, where the meditator juggles with different objects: it could be breath, it could be sensations,maybe feelings, maybe sounds mantras, but they usually converge towards: if the mind wanders away, gently return it back toward the initial object.

The big caveat. If I ask someone what do you know about meditation. Practically all the answers flow towards the word `stress relieve`. And here is the biggest problem of the rookie meditators like me. You start meditating and initially you can get some _"very good sits"_ where you feel very pleasant sensations, like different colors, sometimes light, sometimes you feel so light that it seems you do not have a body at all.

But after you started to dig deeper and deeper and get into your darkness and see with your mind eyes how miserable you are, how much is going on at the subconscious level. Usually the first response including what I sensed is the fear and avoidance, so the stress free part is not so free.

> If you practice daily eventually you will face all your demons (all the emotions that you buried deep down in your subconscious), and I wish you all the courage, devotion and strong determination to overcome them.

But enough about subjective spooky stuff. Let's see how meditation helps me objectively.

## Benefits of meditation

I will present the following list of good things that are developed by serious meditation practice.

- _Concentration power_
- _Tolerance (Equanimity)_
- _Strong determination_

## Concentration power

There are times when you sit in a meeting or at standup, and one of your colleagues is presenting a subject, or even the client is presenting the new feature to be implemented, and you just look in the vain unfocused like you are in a parallel world.

Or other times when you have to create the architecture of a new application, with a lot of features described in 200 pages of documentation, and you just look at this stuff and say to yourself, fuck no! this is impossible.

If you were in one of the above situations, then you probably lack concentration power.

Concentration power is a skill, that can be developed little by little, and the benefits of a concentrated mind are invaluable.

> For me _concentration power_ is like the RAM of a computer, the more it has the better software it can run, and more efficiently.

By practicing meditation you develop a very high degree of concentration power. Objectively the meditation helped me to be much more focused at the work, to write code of a higher quality due the fact that I have a higher degree of concentration power and focus that I can sustain for longer periods of time.

Other point that I observed is that I can understand bigger pieces of code, entire applications, I can debug packages and understand how they are built. For node.js development this is a very common practice, to dive into the code to find what parameters a function can have, or why it is throwing an error cause the documentation on npm packages rarely is adequate.

Am I a master of concentration ? Hell no! I have enormous amount of stuff still to learn, and the paradox is that the deeper I go in meditation, the further the arrival point seems.

## Tolerance

Tolerance is a very shy animal in our society very hard to find one, we are full of ego that blinds us so much that we rarely see things as they are. Software development, is such a good soil for ego development, all programmers think they are so smart... I fall in this trap way to often, which makes me arrogant sometimes.

Tolerant people in a team are invaluable, they energize other team members, they seldom complain, and are not annoyed by every little thing, and when you have tight deadlines and worked the weekends it's extremely hard to keep your composure and be tolerant.

> Conflicts are triggered practically always by prolonged stress activities, and we as humans did not learn other ways to cope with stress other than sharing our "good will" to others.

Meditation comes here as a great teacher, in your sessions when you scream of pain cause your knees are in a bad position, and your timer shows that you have to sit 10 more minutes, the single method to survive this is just to accept things, to be tolerant, you practically are forced into tolerance, and the second day at your job, when someone makes some bad choices and you are reviewing their code you think maybe he is tired, and need some help with the task. Your thought process automatically shifts toward compassion.

## Strong determination

There are many benefits of intensive meditation but what I found in me lately is the _strong determination_ to finish what I started. Given it's a new application for our client, or a side project, or even reading a programming book.

> _Strong determination_ means you are like a wolf who is following it's pray many miles till it drops.

Having this skill developed is a very useful thing, you push harder and harder and the project is moving forward, this is a very motivating quality to see in others.

How explicitly meditation is developing this skill I can't explain yet, it is out of my expertise at this level, in time when I'l be more experienced in meditation I will try to explain in details why meditation is helping strong determination.

In other words this three qualities I see objectively that are developed by continuous practice of meditation, I suggest anyone of you to give it a try, I am not a qualified teacher but I can give you some advice on how to start etc.

As one of the most respected teachers that I follow says:

> May all of you be happy, be free from ignorance and enjoy the real peace within. (S.N. Goenka)
