# Books

Currently I am in a search for advanced books on node.js and javascript, the market is full of _learning node.js books_ with the first 4 chapters on how to install node on mac, windows and linux, and the last 4 to create a _hello world app_.

My starting choice for 2018:

- [Node Cookbook - Third Edition: Actionable solutions for the full spectrum of Node.js 8 development](https://www.amazon.com/Node-Cookbook-Actionable-solutions-development/dp/178588008X) - this book has good recommendations on multiple sites and also covers advanced topics on node.js

- [Node.js Design Patterns by Mario Casciaro](https://www.amazon.com/Node-js-Design-Patterns-Mario-Casciaro/dp/1783287314) - i'v read this book once, but is extremely super strong and didn't get all the examples so need to read it once more.

- [Node.js for Embedded Systems: Using Web Technologies to Build Connected Devices 1st Edition by Patrick Mulder](https://www.amazon.com/Node-js-Embedded-Systems-Technologies-Connected/dp/1491928999) - IoT it is a hot trend want to be able to satisfy the market if needed.

- [Professional JavaScript for Web Developers 4th Edition by Matt Frisbie](https://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Matt-Frisbie/dp/1119366445) - this one was recommended by a strong javascript developer in our company even it is not node.js I skimmed the summary and there are interesting topics that I do not know yet.

> __Important advice!__ When your read a programming book experiment with the examples and try to understand them, there is not much point in reading it like literature.

_If anyone can recommend a strong book on node.js I'l be very thankful._

# Courses

- [Learn DevOps: The Complete Kubernetes Course](https://www.udemy.com/learn-devops-the-complete-kubernetes-course/learn/v4/) - Kubernetes is a docker orchestration tool, used at large for building micro-service oriented architectures.

> Even if am not a big fan of udemy or other learning platforms, usually a course is a very good starter, and in kubernetes I am complete noob so it's ok.

# Practice

As for practice we are building a quite complex system for one of our french customers, so there I'l be able to experiment and implement a micro-service oriented system.

Also I am opened to good start-up ideas, even the vast majority of my startups failed, they were an invaluable source of experience.
